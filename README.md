## The Problem

You've spent hours getting Claude Code just right — MCP servers, plugins, hooks, skills, custom commands, fine-tuned settings. Then:

- 🖥️ **New machine?** Start over from scratch.
- 👥 **Onboarding a teammate?** "Just follow this 47-step wiki page."
- 📂 **Different projects?** Copy-paste configs, hope nothing drifts.
- 🔄 **Something broke?** Good luck figuring out what changed.

## The Solution

`mcs` is a **configuration engine for Claude Code**. It lets you package everything — MCP servers, plugins, hooks, skills, commands, agents, settings, and templates — into shareable **tech packs** (Git repos with a `techpack.yaml` manifest). Then sync them across any project, any machine, in seconds.

> Think of it as **Ansible for your Claude Code environment**: declare what you want in a pack, point `mcs` at it, and the engine converges your setup to the desired state — idempotent, composable, and safe to re-run.

| Without `mcs` | With `mcs` |
|---|---|
| Install MCP servers one by one | `mcs pack add` + `mcs sync` |
| Hand-edit `settings.json` per project | Managed settings composition |
| Copy hooks between projects manually | Auto-installed per-project from packs |
| Configuration drifts silently | `mcs doctor --fix` detects and repairs |
| Rebuild from memory on new machines | Fully reproducible in minutes |
| No way to share your setup | Push a pack, anyone can `mcs pack add` it |

## ✨ Key Features

| | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 📦 | **Tech Packs** | Package your entire Claude setup as a Git repo anyone can install |
| 🔄 | **Convergent Sync** | Re-run safely — adds what's missing, removes what's deselected, updates what changed |
| 🩺 | **Self-Healing** | `mcs doctor --fix` detects configuration drift and repairs it automatically |
| 🎯 | **Per-Project** | Each project gets its own hooks, skills, commands, and settings |
| 🌍 | **Portable** | Recreate your entire environment on a new machine in minutes |
| 🔒 | **Safe** | Backups, dry-run previews, section markers, trust verification, lockfiles |
| 🧩 | **Composable** | Mix and match multiple packs — `mcs` merges them cleanly |
| 🚀 | **Zero Bundled Content** | Pure engine — all features come from the packs you choose |

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 🧑‍💻 Solo Developer — Portable Setup

Got a new Mac? One `mcs pack add` + `mcs sync` and your entire Claude Code environment is back — every MCP server, every hook, every setting. No wiki, no notes, no memory required.

### 👥 Teams — Consistent Environments

Create a team pack with your org's MCP servers, approved plugins, commit hooks, and coding standards. Every developer gets the same setup:

```bash
# New team member onboarding
brew install bguidolim/tap/managed-claude-stack
mcs pack add your-org/team-claude-pack
mcs sync --all
# Done. Everything configured.
```

### 🌐 Open Source — Instant Contributor Setup

Ship a tech pack with your repo. Contributors run `mcs sync` and get the right MCP servers, project-specific skills, and coding conventions automatically. No setup documentation to maintain.

### 🧪 Experimentation — Try, Swap, Roll Back

Want to try a different set of MCP servers? Add a new pack, sync. Don't like it? Remove and re-sync. `mcs` converges cleanly — deselected packs are fully removed, no leftovers.

---

## 🔍 Real-World Examples

Packs are modular — mix and match what you need instead of one monolith:

| Pack | Description | Highlights |
|------|-------------|------------|
| [**mcs-core-pack**](https://github.com/bguidolim/mcs-core-pack) | Foundational settings, plugins, git workflows, and code navigation | Serena (LSP), plan mode, `/commit`, PR review agents, session-start git status |
| [**mcs-continuous-learning**](https://github.com/bguidolim/mcs-continuous-learning) | Persistent memory and knowledge management across sessions | Ollama embeddings, semantic search via `docs-mcp-server`, auto-extracted learnings |
| [**mcs-ios-pack**](https://github.com/bguidolim/mcs-ios-pack) | Xcode integration, simulator management, and Apple documentation | XcodeBuildMCP, Sosumi docs, auto-detected project config, simulator hooks |

> 💡 Use these as a starting point — fork one to build your own, or combine all three with `mcs pack add` for a complete setup.

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
 Tech Packs          mcs sync          Your Project
 (Git repos)  -----> (engine)  -----> (configured)
                        |
                   .---------.
                   |         |
                   v         v
              Per-Project  Global
              artifacts    artifacts
```

When you run `mcs sync` in a project directory:

1. **Select** which packs to apply (interactive multi-select or `--all`)
2. **Resolve** prompts (auto-detect project files, ask for config values)
3. **Install** artifacts to the right locations:

| Artifact | Location | Scope |
|----------|----------|-------|
| MCP servers | `~/.claude.json` | Per-project (keyed by path) |
| Skills | `<project>/.claude/skills/` | Per-project |
| Hooks | `<project>/.claude/hooks/` | Per-project |
| Commands | `<project>/.claude/commands/` | Per-project |
| Agents | `<project>/.claude/agents/` | Per-project |
| Settings | `<project>/.claude/settings.local.json` | Per-project |
| Templates | `<project>/CLAUDE.local.md` | Per-project |

4. **Track** everything in `<project>/.claude/.mcs-project` for convergence

Re-running `mcs sync` converges to the desired state — new packs added, deselected packs fully cleaned up, unchanged packs updated idempotently. It's safe to run as many times as you want.

Use `mcs sync --global` for global-scope components (Homebrew packages, plugins, global MCP servers).

## 📦 What's in a Tech Pack?

A tech pack is a Git repository with a `techpack.yaml` manifest. It can include any combination of:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 🍺 `brew` | CLI dependencies | `brew: node` |
| 🔌 `mcp` | MCP servers (stdio or HTTP) | `mcp: { command: npx, args: [...] }` |
| 🧩 `plugin` | Claude Code plugins | `plugin: "my-plugin@publisher"` |
| ⚡ `hook` | Session lifecycle scripts | `hook: { source: hooks/start.sh }` |
| 🎓 `skill` | Domain knowledge & workflows | `skill: { source: skills/my-skill }` |
| 💬 `command` | Custom `/slash` commands | `command: { source: commands/deploy.md }` |
| 🤖 `agent` | Custom subagents | `agent: { source: agents/code-reviewer.md }` |
| ⚙️ `settingsFile` | Settings for `settings.local.json` | `settingsFile: config/settings.json` |
| 📝 `templates` | CLAUDE.local.md instructions | Placeholder substitution with `__VAR__` |
| 🔍 `doctorChecks` | Health verification & auto-repair | Command existence, settings validation |

### Creating Your Own Pack

```bash
mkdir my-pack && cd my-pack && git init

# Create your techpack.yaml (see docs for full schema)
cat > techpack.yaml << 'EOF'
schemaVersion: 1
identifier: my-pack
displayName: My Pack
author: "Your Name"

components:
  - id: my-server
    description: My MCP server
    mcp:
      command: npx
      args: ["-y", "my-server@latest"]
EOF

git add -A && git commit -m "Initial pack"
# Push to GitHub, then:
# mcs pack add https://github.com/you/my-pack
```
